# **Expense Tracker 💰**

A **Splitwise-like** fullstack web service for tracking personal and household expenses.  
Why reinvent the wheel when there's already a great app out there? **Because I can.**  
And because **exploring new technologies is way more fun than just using someone else’s work.** 😎

## **🚀 Technologies**

### **Backend**

-   **Go** – Because speed and concurrency are my best friends.
-   **Gin** – A fast and handy web framework for Go.
-   **PostgreSQL** – Because data persistence is important (unlike my New Year’s resolutions).

### **Frontend**

-   **React** – Switched from HTMX for **more power and flexibility**.
-   **TypeScript** – Strict types mean fewer bugs, and fewer bugs mean less debugging.
-   **TailwindCSS 4** – Utility-first styling that **keeps CSS fun and efficient**.
-   **DaisyUI 5** – Making Tailwind components even prettier.

## **🔮 Future Features**

✨ **OCR Receipt Recognition** – Because manually entering expenses is **so last decade**.  
✨ **Auto-Fill Expenses** – Let AI handle the boring stuff while you focus on spending wisely… or not.

## **💡 Why This Project?**

Sure, **Splitwise exists**, but where’s the fun in using something pre-made?  
This project is a playground to **explore backend optimizations, frontend efficiency, and AWS deployment strategies**.

> _After all, if software engineers didn't reinvent the wheel, we'd still be riding square ones._ 🔄💡

🚀 **Stay tuned for updates!**
